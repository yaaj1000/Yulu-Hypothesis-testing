# Yulu-Hypothesis-testing

In this project, Yulu- India's leading micro-mobility service provider, I will analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared electric cycles in the Indian market. Yulu has experienced fluctuations in its revenues and is seeking to understand the key variables that affect the usage of their electric cycles.

To achieve this, i will perform an in-depth data analysis, including exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing.I aim to identify significant variables that predict the demand for these cycles and assess how well these variables describe the demand patterns.

My analysis will involve statistical tests such as 2-sample t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to examine relationships between various factors like working days, seasons, weather conditions, and cycle demand. By conducting this analysis, I intend to provide valuable insights to Yulu.
